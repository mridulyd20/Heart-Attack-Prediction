# Heart-Attack-Prediction
This project is a Heart Attack Prediction System developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter GUI library, integrating multimedia components like OpenCV for background video playback and Pygame for alert sounds. It allows users to input medical parameters and get a basic prediction about heart attack risk based on rule-based logic.
